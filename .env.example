# RevenueCat Configuration
# Get your API keys from: https://app.revenuecat.com/
# 
# YOUR API KEY: test_amHZgULphTOfAXgpIlAcujAxXvZ
# 
# IMPORTANT: This is a TEST key. For production, use your production API key.
# 
# Note: RevenueCat API keys are PUBLIC keys and safe to expose in your app.
# They only identify your app and don't grant privileged access.
# The actual subscription verification happens on RevenueCat's servers.
#
# For this implementation, the API key is hardcoded in utils/revenueCatService.ts
# You can also use environment variables if preferred:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_API_KEY=test_amHZgULphTOfAXgpIlAcujAxXvZ

# ============================================
# SECURITY NOTE: API Keys
# ============================================
# Google AI API Key is NOT stored in this file for security reasons.
# It's securely stored in Supabase Edge Function environment variables.
# All AI features (quotes, chatbot, hadith, etc.) are handled through
# the backend API at: /functions/v1/ai-service
#
# To configure the Google AI API key:
# 1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Edge Functions > ai-service
# 3. Add GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY to the function's environment variables
# 4. Get your key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
#
# This approach keeps your API key secure and prevents exposure in:
# - Client-side code
# - Version control (git)
# - App bundles
# - Network requests
#
# AI Features include:
# - Enhanced Quran quotes with context and reflections
# - Islamic Q&A chatbot
# - Daily Hadith with AI-generated explanations
# - Spiritual guidance and personalized duas
# - Prayer reflections
# ============================================

# Supabase Configuration (already configured in client.ts)
