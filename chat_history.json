The app will detect the user's location to provide accurate daily prayer times, and it will feature inspirational quotes from the Quran, generated by Gemini, to enrich the user's spiritual experience. Here is the plan for your new application: Specification Core Functionality: The app's primary purpose is to display the five daily Islamic prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) based on the user's current geographical location. Automatic Location Detection: Upon loading, the application will request permission to access the user's location. If granted, it will automatically fetch coordinates to ensure prayer timings are accurate. If denied, it will gracefully inform the user that location is required for the app to function. Inspirational Quotes: To provide a moment of reflection, the app will display a short, inspiring quote from the Quran. This quote will be dynamically generated by the Gemini API each time the app is opened. Real-Time Clock & Next Prayer Highlight: A live clock will be displayed, and the upcoming prayer will be visually highlighted to make it easy for the user to see how much time is left. Desktop Notifications: The app will ask for permission to send notifications. Once a prayer time arrives, a desktop notification will be sent to remind the user. UI/UX Design: The user interface will be clean, modern, and serene, using a calming color palette of soft beige, deep teal, and white. The typography will be elegant and highly readable. The overall design aims to be respectful and create a peaceful digital environment for the user. Enhance the app to include fetching and displaying quotes from the Quran. Display a quote before the first prayer of the day and another one after the last prayer of the day. Ensure the quotes are relevant to prayer or faith. Use the existing fetchQuote function for this purpose. Implement a Qibla direction finder feature using the user's location. Display a visual indicator (like a compass or an arrow) showing the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca relative to the user's current orientation. This will require requesting additional permissions for device orientation if available, or a manual input for the user's compass direction.Refactor the prayer item component to include a subtle animation when a prayer is marked as 'next'. The animation should make the 'next' prayer item slightly scale up or have a gentle pulse effect. design the user interface to evoke a more serene and traditional \"Quran vibe,\" drawing inspiration from classic Islamic art and calligraphy."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You want me to create a plan for building a prayer reminder application with location-based prayer times, inspirational Quran quotes, a Qibla direction finder, and a serene, Islamic-inspired design. Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   Display the five daily prayer times based on the user's location.\n*   Show inspirational quotes from the Quran, displayed before the first prayer and after the last prayer of the day.\n*   Implement a Qibla direction finder using the user's location.\n*   Include a real-time clock and highlight the next upcoming prayer.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Soft Beige)\n    *   Text: `#004643` (Deep Teal)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#004643` (Deep Teal)\n    *   Secondary: `#D4A373` (Light Brown)\n    *   Accent: `#D4A373` (Light Brown)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E07A5F` (Burnt Orange)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts that are highly readable and evoke a sense of tradition, such as \"Noto Sans Arabic\" for the quotes and a simple sans-serif font like \"System\" for the rest of the UI.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Location Services:**\n    *   Request location permissions from the user.\n    *   Use the location data to calculate prayer times.\n\n2.  **Quran Quotes:**\n    *   Implement the logic to fetch and display quotes from the Quran before the first prayer and after the last prayer.\n    *   Ensure the quotes are relevant to prayer or faith.\n\n3.  **Qibla Direction Finder:**\n    *   Request permissions for device orientation (if available).\n    *   Implement the Qibla direction finder using the user's location and device orientation.\n    *   Display a visual indicator showing the direction of the Kaaba.\n\n4.  **Prayer Time Display:**\n    *   Display the five daily prayer times in a clear and organized manner.\n    *   Highlight the next upcoming prayer with a subtle animation (scaling or pulsing effect).\n\n5.  **UI/UX Design:**\n    *   Implement the color palette and typography as specified above.\n    *   Incorporate design elements inspired by classic Islamic art and calligraphy.\n    *   Ensure the interface is clean, modern, and serene.\n\n6.  **Notifications:**\n    *   Request permission to send notifications.\n    *   Send desktop notifications to remind the user when a prayer time arrives.\n\nNow, let's start implementing this plan. I will provide instructions to the coding agent to modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make them visible for the user.

AR Qibla Compass Description: An augmented reality view that uses the phone's camera to overlay a clear, animated path pointing directly to the Kaaba in Mecca. It would provide a more intuitive and accurate experience than a standard 2D compass, especially for travelers. Advanced Notification Suite Description: Go beyond the standard prayer time alert. Allow users to set custom pre-prayer reminders (e.g., \"15 minutes before Dhuhr to prepare\"). They could also choose different notification sounds for each prayer or even upload their own tones. Interactive Islamic (Hijri) Calendar Description: A fully integrated Hijri calendar that highlights significant Islamic dates, such as the start of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha. Users could add personal events and see both Gregorian and Hijri dates side-by-side. Dua & Dhikr Library with Tasbeeh Counter Description: A curated, searchable library of supplications (Duas) for various occasions (morning, evening, after prayer, etc.). Each Dua would include the Arabic text, transliteration, translation, and audio recitation. A built-in digital Tasbeeh counter would help users keep track of their Dhikr. \"Verse of the Day\" & Mini Quran Reader Description: Instead of a static quote, this feature would present a new, inspiring verse from the Quran each day. Tapping on it would open a lightweight, searchable Quran reader within the app, allowing users to explore the Surah in more context. Nearby Mosque Finder Description: A map-based utility that helps users find the nearest mosques. It could provide essential details like congregational prayer (Jama'ah) times, address, contact information, and available facilities (e.g., women's prayer area, parking). Personalized Spiritual Progress Tracker Description: A private journal for users to track their spiritual habits. They could log their daily prayers, fasting days, Quran reading, and acts of charity. Visual graphs and gentle reminders would help them stay consistent and motivated. Home Screen & Lock Screen Widgets Description: Beautifully designed widgets for iOS and Android that display the day's prayer times and a live countdown to the next prayer directly on the user's home or lock screen, providing key information without needing to open the app. Smartwatch Companion App Description: A dedicated app for Apple Watch, Wear OS, and other smartwatches.
